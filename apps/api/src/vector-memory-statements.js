// THIS FILE IS THE SECURITY BOUNDARY. There is deliberately no general query

// interpolated text. A bug in a route therefore cannot become a data breach or
// an arbitrary-read primitive.
//
// Rules enforced by `apps/api/test/vector-memory-statements.test.mjs`:
//   1. Every statement is a static string literal. No template interpolation,
//      no concatenation, no runtime construction.
//   2. Every statement is fully schema-qualified to `mhelix_testwired`.
//   3. Every statement's parameters are positional placeholders numbered
//      exactly $1..$n with no gaps.
//   4. No statement performs DELETE, TRUNCATE, DROP, ALTER, CREATE, GRANT,
//      REVOKE, UPSERT, or ON CONFLICT. Memory is append-only; the only updates
//      are the three reviewed lifecycle transitions.
//   5. No statement uses `SELECT *`, so a later column addition can never
//      widen a response by accident.
//   6. Every read of the embedding table selects references and distances
//      only. The stored vector and its commitment are never returned to a
//      caller.
//
// Reviewed against migration 001 and migration 002 column names.
